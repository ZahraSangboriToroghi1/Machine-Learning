Finding the best neighborhood to open a new gym
Introduction
Finding the best neighborhood in Tornoto city to open a new gym, given the demographic and geogrpahic and venues information data.

Data
The dataset used to solve this problem have the following informtion:

The demogrpahics information: They are the total population, the 15-45 poulation, the number of educated people and the number of employers in each neighborhood.
The graphical data (lat,long) for each neighborhood is used to get the venues information for each neighborhood from Foursquare API.
The neighbourhoods on the map are shown in the figure below neighborhood_map From the Foursquare API the number of venues per each neighbourhood and the number of Gym/Fitness centers per each neighbourhood were calculated and then merged with the demographics data and the final data used is as the shown in the figure below. total_data The final dataset can be found here

Methodology
Data preprocessing
The data were normalized using the min-max normalization. This is an important step because the k-means algorithms depend on distance measurement, so it is important that the data used be in a similar scale. The formula of the min-max scaler is as the following: 𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒−min⁡(𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒)max⁡(𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒)−min⁡(𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒) The neighborhood and the geographical data were dropped from the data as they will be used by the clustering algorithm.

K-means clustering
The best k was found using the elbow method, in which the average distance from the clusters is calculated for different values of k and the best k is the k at the elbow. The best k was found to be 3.

Results
The neighborhoods are clustered into three clusters as shown in the figure below. The red color is the first cluster, the violet is the second cluster, green is the third cluster. clsuters on the map

Conclusion
Using the demographics data and the venue information for each neighborhood obtained from Foursquare API, I was able to cluster the neighborhoods into three clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm. The number of gyms was found to be correlated to the number of venues. The neighborhoods with a large number of venues and gyms are clustered into the third cluster, so the most suitable neighborhood out of this cluster is the Trinity-Bellwoods neighborhood. The first cluster contains neighborhoods with large population and small number of gyms and moderate number of venues. The Church-Yonge Corridor neighborhood is the best choice out of this cluster as it contains 98 venues and large population. The number of venues is almost similar to that of the “Trinity-Bellwoods” and the population is double of it, making it the best neighborhood to open a new gym in Toronto city.

The respiratory brain pulsations related to axial intraparenchymal hydrodynamic solute transport in focal epilepsy are significantly altered. We utilized optical flow analysis of ultrafast functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to investigate the characteristics of the propagation velocity of respiratory brain pulses in patients with focal epilepsy under treatment with anti-seizure medications (ASM) (medicated epilepsy patients, ME, n = 23), unmedicated patients with at least one seizure (DN, n = 19), and matched healthy controls (HC, n = 75). We identified several significant changes in the propagation speed of respiratory brain pulsations in both patient groups (ME and DN), indicating a bilateral shift predominantly characterized by a decrease in speed. Additionally, in both patient groups compared to the HC group, respiratory pulsations moved more frequently in reverse or incoherent directions. The reduction in speed and changes in direction occurred at specific phases of the respiratory cycle. As a result, regardless of medication status, both patient groups exhibited slower and more incoherent respiratory brain pulsations, which may contribute to epileptic brain pathology by hindering brain hydrodynamics.
